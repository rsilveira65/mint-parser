# MINT Parser
## About
Work and constantly have to check feed from different sources like Teamwork, HipChat and GitLab, sometimes it’s a boring job, right?
So, the MINT Parser it's a tool written in PHP that I’m developing to help me at work displaying all feed inside the terminal (and help to learn new techs like Symfony console, composer and API’S).

## Configuration
To configure the application, set the follow parameters:
```bash
.
└── mint-paser
    └── config
        └── parameters.yml
```

## Run
In your console, run:

```bash
composer install
```

```bash
php mint-parser.php run
```
